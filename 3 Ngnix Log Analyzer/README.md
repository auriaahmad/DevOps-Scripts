Here is a shell script that meets the requirements for analyzing the `nginx-access.log.txt` file. The script makes use of `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `head` to extract the required information.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Download the log file**: Make sure you have the log file `nginx-access.log.txt` downloaded and saved in the directory where you will be running the script.

2. **Create the Script**: Save the following script as `nginx-log-analyzer.sh` in the same directory as the log file.

### Script: `nginx-log-analyzer.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the log file location
LOG_FILE="nginx-access.log.txt"

# Check if log file exists
if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: Log file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests
echo "Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests:"
awk '{print $1}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 | awk '{print $2 " - " $1 " requests"}'
echo ""

# Top 5 most requested paths
echo "Top 5 most requested paths:"
awk '{print $7}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 | awk '{print $2 " - " $1 " requests"}'
echo ""

# Top 5 response status codes
echo "Top 5 response status codes:"
awk '{print $9}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 | awk '{print $2 " - " $1 " requests"}'
echo ""

# Top 5 user agents
echo "Top 5 user agents:"
awk -F'"' '{print $6}' "$LOG_FILE" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 | awk '{print $2 " - " $1 " requests"}'
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Script:

1. **Define the Log File**:
   - The script defines the location of the `nginx-access.log.txt` file using the variable `LOG_FILE`.

2. **Check for Log File Existence**:
   - It checks if the log file exists. If the file is not found, the script exits with an error message.

3. **Extracting and Displaying Information**:
   - **Top 5 IP addresses**:
     - The script uses `awk '{print $1}'` to extract the IP address (first field in the log file), followed by `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr` to count and sort them in descending order, and `head -5` to display the top 5.
   - **Top 5 most requested paths**:
     - The script extracts the request path (7th field in the log file) using `awk '{print $7}'`, then follows a similar process to count and display the top 5 most requested paths.
   - **Top 5 response status codes**:
     - The status code (9th field) is extracted with `awk '{print $9}'`, and the same counting and sorting process is applied.
   - **Top 5 user agents**:
     - The user agent (field between double quotes) is extracted using `awk -F'"' '{print $6}'`, followed by counting, sorting, and displaying the top 5.

### How to Save, Make Executable, and Run the Script:

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Open your terminal and use `nano` or another editor to create the file:
     ```bash
     nano nginx-log-analyzer.sh
     ```

2. **Paste the Script**:
   - Copy the provided script into the `nano` editor.

3. **Save and Exit `nano`**:
   - Press `Ctrl + O`, then hit `Enter` to save the file.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit `nano`.

4. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x nginx-log-analyzer.sh
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - To run the script and analyze the log file, use:
     ```bash
     ./nginx-log-analyzer.sh
     ```

### Output Example:

```
Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests:
45.76.135.253 - 1000 requests
142.93.143.8 - 600 requests
178.128.94.113 - 50 requests
43.224.43.187 - 30 requests
178.128.94.113 - 20 requests

Top 5 most requested paths:
/api/v1/users - 1000 requests
/api/v1/products - 600 requests
/api/v1/orders - 50 requests
/api/v1/payments - 30 requests
/api/v1/reviews - 20 requests

Top 5 response status codes:
200 - 1000 requests
404 - 600 requests
500 - 50 requests
401 - 30 requests
304 - 20 requests

Top 5 user agents:
Mozilla/5.0 - 1000 requests
curl/7.64.1 - 600 requests
PostmanRuntime/7.26.10 - 50 requests
Wget/1.20.3 - 30 requests
Python-urllib/3.7 - 20 requests
```

### Alternative Approaches (Stretch Goal):
You can explore using other tools like `grep` or `sed` instead of `awk` to achieve the same results. For example, to find the most requested paths using `grep`:

```bash
grep -oP '"\w+ /[^ ]+' nginx-access.log.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5
```
